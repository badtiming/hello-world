# hello-world

I have no idea what the hell I'm doing but I'm trying to grind through the Odin project because I hate my life and want to make drastic changes
First thing it says to do is use Github to sign into their discussion page, and I'm getting a fucking 405 error every time I try to do that, so now I'm here fucking around with Github instead of following the curriculum I signed up for because the VERY FIRST STEP IN THE PROCESS is giving me errors and I haven't even written a single fucking line of code yet
